# Agentic Playbook — shared plan

**The authoritative design document is [`PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md). Read it before starting any task
in this epic.** It holds the locked decisions (deliverable, reader, tone, structure), the full
book outline, and the play template. This file tracks execution and accumulates decisions made
during the build.

## Locked decisions (do not relitigate without asking)

- Markdown book in this repo, chapters as files.
- Reader: working developers already using agentic tools daily.
- Tone: dry and wry — sharp asides in the framing, never inside instructions.
- Plays-first: framing ~15%, plays ~60%, failure modes ~15%, next waves ~10%.
- Tools are examples *inside* plays, never section headings.

## Conventions

- Book chapters live in `book/`, research briefs in `notes/research/`, raw ideation in
  `notes/raw/` (frozen — do not edit).
- Every play uses the template defined by the style-guide task: Problem → The play → Worked
  example → Failure mode → Checklist.
- Research briefs are cited notes, not prose. Writers draw from them.
- Any build/helper scripts are Python, not Node.

## Running log

Append decisions, discovered constraints, and cross-task notes here as work proceeds.

- Ideation consolidated; `idea.md` / `plot-1.md` / `plot-2.md` moved to `notes/raw/` and replaced
  by `PLAN.md`.
